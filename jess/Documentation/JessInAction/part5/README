These are two versions of the HVAC control system from part 5 of "Jess
in Action:" The initial, non-fuzzy version and the final fuzzy-logic
version." The Java code for each of these is included in a Java
package. The non-fuzzy version is in package "control" and the fuzzy
version is in "fuzzy". 

To execute the non-fuzzy example, assuming jess.jar is on your
classpath, you can just type 

   java jess.Main control/control.clp

To run the fuzzy example, you'll need to get the FuzzyJ toolkit from
http://www.iit.nrc.ca/IR_public/fuzzy/fuzzyJToolkit.html . Download
the software, unzip the file into a directory named "fuzzy", and
determine the name of the main JAR file (currently named
fuzzy/fuzzyJ15a.jar). Add this JAR file to your classpath. You can
then run the fuzzy example using

  jave nrc.fuzzy.jess.FuzzyMain fuzzy/control.clp

There is a DOS batch file fuzzy/control.bat which you may wish to
modify and use to run this example.
