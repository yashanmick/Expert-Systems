Examples for part 6 of "Jess in Action"

The directory hello contains the Hello and HelloJess servlets from
chapter 19, sections 19.1 through 19.3. See the text for information
about deploying them in Tomcat or another web application server.

The directory "order" contains the complete Recommendations Agent web
application. Again, you'll need to consult the text for information
about installing these in a servlet container.
